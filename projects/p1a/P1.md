# CS537 p1a: WizBloomZip

**Before beginning:** Read this [lab tutorial](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/lab-tutorial.pdf); it has some useful tips for programming in the C environment.
Our tests and grading will be conducted on the [CSL Lab instructional Linux computers](https://csl.cs.wisc.edu/docs/csl/2014-11-03-instructional-linux-computers/).

This project will build a simple tool, `WizBloomZip`, which compresses a file
containing lines of strings.  We will get in tough with C libraries like [zstd](https://github.com/facebook/zstd.git),
get familiar with the C standard library functions to manipulate files, and play
with a cool data structure [*bloom filter*](https://github.com/jvirkki/libbloom.git) to boost
performance while querying a compressed file (yes, another library, don't worry
to implement it in this project). Read below for details!

## Background and Setup

We first `git clone` the two libraries' source code into the `$PROJ` directory
that contains the provided Makefile and the WizBloomZip.c and also build the libraries.
We provide the WizBloomZip.c and basic handling of command line flags to start with.

Zstandard (zstd) is a real-time compression algorithm that offers high compression
ratios and a wide range of compression/speed trade-offs, coupled with a fast
decoder.

A Bloom filter[^1][^2] is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure used to test
whether an element belongs to a set. In this utility, it's employed to quickly
check if a key exists within a compressed file without the need to decompress
the entire file.


```
cd $PROJ
git clone https://github.com/facebook/zstd.git
cd zstd
make
cd $PROJ
git clone https://github.com/jvirkki/libbloom.git
cd libbloom
make
cd $PROJ
```

Now the directory of `$PROJ` (i.e., p1a) looks like this:

```
p1a
├── gen_test.py
├── libbloom
│   ├── ...
│   ├── build
│   │   ├── bloom.o
│   │   ├── libbloom.a
│   │   ├── libbloom.so -> libbloom.so.2
│   │   ├── libbloom.so.2 -> libbloom.so.2.0
│   │   ├── libbloom.so.2.0
├── Makefile
├── P1.md
├── run_test.sh
├── WizBloomZip.c
└── zstd
|   ├── lib
|   ├── ...
```

Simply run `make && ./WizBloomZip -h` to see what happens!  

## Key Features

### 1. File Compression

WizBloomZip compresses input files using [zstd](https://github.com/facebook/zstd) 
and writes the compressed data into an output file. 

### 2. Bloom Filter Generation

During the compression process if `-b` flag is specified, WizBloomZip generates
a Bloom filter from the contents of the input file. The Bloom filter is then
saved to a designated file.

### 3. Querying with a Key

If `-k` is specified, the utility is in *query mode* to query a key within a
compressed file specified by `-f` flag.  If a Bloom filter file is specified
(again by `-b`), the utility first checks the key against the Bloom filter. If
the check get a *Not Existing*, the utility will not read the compressed file
and directly return to the use. Otherwise, `WizBloomZip` proceeds to decompress
the file and scan for the key line by line.

### Usage
The command-line usage of the WizBloomZip utility is:

`WizBloomZip -f <file> -o [output] -b [bloom_filter] -k [key]`

- `-f <file>`: Input file.
- `-o [output]`: Output file for compressed data.
- `-b [bloom_filter]`: File to save the Bloom filter.
- `-k [key]`: Key to query within the compressed file.

The utility contains two modes, *Compress* and *Query*

#### Examples

```
# Compress (basic)
prompt> WizBloomZip -f foo.txt -o foo.wizip
# Compress (with a Bloom Filter)
prompt> WizBloomZip -f foo.txt -o foo.wizip -b foo.bloom
# Query (basic)
prompt> WizBloomZip -f foo.wizip -k jingliu
# Query (with a Bloom Filter)
prompt> WizBloomZip -f foo.wizip -b foo.bloom -k jingliu
```

## Project Guidelines

We've supplied the skeleton code for argument handling and output in
`WizBloomZip.c`. Your task is to implement the functions `compress_one_file` and
`query_one_key`. Please ensure you use `print_key_position` to display the query
results - our tests rely on this function and it should not be modified.

1. **Understand the Code Structure**: Start by understanding how the code is structured and how the different parts interact. Read through the comments and use external resources to understand any unfamiliar concepts or functions.

2. **Familiarize Yourself with ZSTD and Bloom Filters**: You need to understand these two concepts as they are central to this project. There are many online resources that explain these two topics.
You don't need to delve into their implementations, but understanding their functions and usage in this project's API is essential. The necessary APIs are listed in the upcoming sections.

3. **Start Small**: Don't try to implement everything at once. Begin by ensuring that you can successfully compress and decompress a file using ZSTD. Then, move on to adding the Bloom filter.

4. **Implement Error Handling**: The utility involves file I/O operations, so it's important to handle any errors that may arise from these operations, such as the inability to open a file, or insufficient memory space.

5. **Test Your Code**: After implementing a feature, test it thoroughly to make sure it works as expected. This will help you catch any bugs or errors early on.

6. **Ask for Help When Stuck**: Don't hesitate to ask for help if you're having trouble understanding a concept or figuring out why your code isn't working. You can ask your instructors, classmates, or use online resources. 


Remember, the goal of the project isn't just to produce a working program, but also to understand the concepts and techniques you're using. Good luck!


## Zstd and Libloom interfaces

### zstd (Zstandard)

**1. `ZSTD_compressBound(size_t srcSize)`:**

This function provides the maximum size of compressed data in worst case scenario. It accepts as parameter the size of the data to be compressed. This is useful when allocating space for the compressed data.

**2. `ZSTD_compress(void* dst, size_t dstCapacity, const void* src, size_t srcSize, int compressionLevel)`:**

This function compresses the data in 'src' buffer into the 'dst' buffer. The size of the source data is provided by 'srcSize', and the size of the destination buffer is provided by 'dstCapacity'. 'compressionLevel' is the level of compression to be applied.

**3. `ZSTD_getFrameContentSize(const void* src, size_t srcSize)`:**

This function provides the decompressed size of a compressed source buffer. It is useful when allocating space for the decompressed data.

**4. `ZSTD_decompress(void* dst, size_t dstCapacity, const void* src, size_t compressedSize)`:**

This function decompresses the data in 'src' buffer into the 'dst' buffer. The size of the compressed data is provided by 'compressedSize', and the size of the destination buffer is provided by 'dstCapacity'.

### libbloom

**1. `bloom_init2(struct bloom* bloom, int entries, double error)`:**

This function initializes a Bloom filter with an expected number of entries and a desired false positive rate (error rate). 'entries' represents the expected number of entries to be added to the Bloom filter, and 'error' is the acceptable false positive rate. Please use the `g_bloom_entries` and `g_bloom_error` in `WizBloomZip.c`.

**2. `bloom_add(struct bloom* bloom, const void *buffer, int len)`:**

This function adds an entry to the Bloom filter. The 'buffer' parameter points to the data to be added and 'len' represents the length of the data.

**3. `bloom_check(struct bloom* bloom, const void *buffer, int len)`:**

This function checks if an entry is present in the Bloom filter. It returns 1 if the entry might be in the set, and 0 if the entry is definitely not in the set.

**4. `bloom_save(struct bloom* bloom, const char *filename)`:**

This function writes the Bloom filter to a file specified by 'filename'.

**5. `bloom_load(struct bloom* bloom, const char *filename)`:**

This function reads a Bloom filter from a file specified by 'filename'.
